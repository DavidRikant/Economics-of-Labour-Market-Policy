# Project on Economics of Labour Market Policy

## Goal of the Term Paper

The document is a study that uses 2021 Census data to analyze the relationship between marital status and employment income in Canada. The study focuses on individuals aged 20-64 who identified as active employees and examines factors such as marital status, gender, education, and regional variables. The study uses multiple linear regressions and the extended Mincer model to identify statistical associations and provide insights relevant to policies aimed at reducing income inequality and tackling gender-based economic disparities. The study also employs the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition to quantify the wage gap between married and unmarried individuals, providing detailed insights that can be used by organizations and policymakers to manage and adjust the problematic components contributing to the wage gap.


## Key Findings:

- The study focuses on the relationship between marital status and employment income in Canada, using 2021 Census data.

- Descriptive statistics reveal that the sample captures diverse demographic characteristics, providing a foundation for informed policy discussions.

- The study emphasizes the importance of understanding demographic characteristics to address specific needs and disparities in the Canadian labor market.

- Multiple linear regressions and the extended Mincer model are used to analyze factors contributing to income disparities, particularly in exploring the relationship between wage differentials and marital status.

## Techniques Used:

- Multiple linear regressions: Systematically parsing the variables that contribute to income disparities.

- Extended Mincer model: Incorporates an array of demographic and educational factors, with extensions to the analysis along two primary dimensions: marital status and gender.

- Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition: Used to analyze differences in average log employment wages for non-married and married individuals, providing insights for policymakers to manage and adjust the problematic components contributing to the wage gap.

Overall, the document presents a comprehensive analysis of the factors influencing income differentials in Canada, with a focus on marital status, gender, education, age, and regional disparities. It also highlights existing policies and recommendations to address wage gaps and gender-based economic inequalities, providing valuable insights for policymakers and organizations aiming to reduce income disparities and promote equality in the Canadian labor market.

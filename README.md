# Project on Economics of Labour Market Policy

## Goal of the Term Paper

The document discusses a study that examines the relationship between marital status and employment income in Canada using 2021 Census data. The study employs multiple linear regressions to analyze factors contributing to income disparities, with a focus on marital status, gender, education, age, and regional variables. The results indicate that being married is associated with higher incomes, and there is evidence of a gender wage gap, with women earning less on average. The study also explores regional disparities and the impact of educational attainment on income levels. Additionally, it discusses existing policies and recommendations to address wage differentials and gender-based economic inequalities, such as human rights legislation, the Pay Equity Act, and family-friendly policies. The study provides insights for policymakers to develop interventions aimed at reducing income inequalities and addressing gender-based economic discrepancies in the Canadian labor market.

Expanding on the document, the study also utilizes the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition to quantify the explained and unexplained portions of the wage gap for married and unmarried individuals, revealing a significant unexplained wage gap. The study recommends investing in training programs tailored to different job fields and providing financial alternatives for individuals with lower educational attainment, particularly for women. Furthermore, the document discusses the methodological approach, including the use of multiple linear regressions and the extended Mincer model to identify statistical associations and provide insights relevant for policies aimed at reducing income inequality and tackling gender-based economic disparities. The study also examines the impact of regional disparities and age-related effects on the wage gap, providing detailed insights that can be used by organizations and policymakers to manage and adjust the problematic components contributing to income disparities.

Overall, the document presents a comprehensive analysis of the factors influencing income differentials in Canada, with a focus on marital status, gender, education, age, and regional disparities. It also highlights existing policies and recommendations to address wage gaps and gender-based economic inequalities, providing valuable insights for policymakers and organizations aiming to reduce income disparities and promote equality in the Canadian labor market.
